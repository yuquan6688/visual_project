He advised that we need only include the most valuable, coherent visuals in the app—selecting key charts rather than embedding every chart from our previous work—and noted that the app should enable users to explore relationships interactively, not merely present answers. He clarified that it is acceptable to focus on just the three questions we have prioritized for this phase (with the fourth optional if time allows) and that we have discretion in structuring our content—combining related network graphs into a single tab or splitting them into subtabs as best suits clarity."

The Network Analysis panel includes selections for ego network order, network layout by centrality type, entity type, and influence category. A supporting table below the graph displays values for PageRank, betweenness, and degree centrality.\nTrang also developed two panels: Relationship Network and Clustering Analysis. The Relationship Network panel enables filtering by relationship sub-types and entity sub-types, with a table displaying centrality insights. The Clustering Analysis panel allows viewers to filter by entity sub-types, clustering method, and minimum communication frequency, with results similarly shown in a detailed table.\nTrang proposed combining her network panel with Yuquan’s, given the overlap in network visualizations. Yuquan agreed with this consolidation approach.\nQiuYan presented several interactive visualizations: a timeline, a temporal pattern heatmap, a bar chart of communication partners, and a content analysis table. These are organized into separate tabs and filtered by date range. Trang suggested combining the timeline with the content analysis side-by-side for better contextual understanding and integrating temporal and communication patterns into a unified view.

    "text": "Our team developed a Shiny-based visual analytics application titled Behind the Reef to investigate hidden corruption and illicit networks in Oceanus’s tourism and environmental sectors. This project was built in response to the 2025 VAST Challenge – Mini-Challenge 3, based on intercepted radio communications and event metadata collected over two weeks by investigative journalist Clepper Jessen.\nThe dataset, organized as a knowledge graph of entities, events, and relationships, is large and complex, making it difficult to trace meaningful patterns manually. Our application empowers users to uncover suspicious communication patterns, identify key influencers, and explore tightly connected subgroups within this intricate network.\nBehind the Reef features two core components:\n\nA Time-Based Analysis module that allows users to explore hourly or daily communication trends through interactive charts. Investigators can isolate peak activity windows, compare different weeks, and detect anomalies over time.\nAn interactive network analysis dashboard that combines ego-network, relationship-based, and clustering visualizations. Users can explore influence metrics such as PageRank, Betweenness, and Degree; search for specific entities; and filter by relationship type or subnetwork density—enabling the discovery of power brokers, covert coordinators, and high-risk clusters.\n\nBy blending temporal and structural analysis in an intuitive interface, our app offers a scalable investigative tool that helps make sense of dense communication data, allowing analysts to “see beneath the surface” and expose what lies behind the reef."

    "text": "This project seeks to uncover hidden influence and illicit activity within the Oceanus community, where tensions are rising following a government crackdown on illegal fishing. As the local economy shifts toward ocean tourism, new entanglements have emerged involving celebrities, local officials, conservation groups, and powerful business families.\nTo investigate these developments, journalist Clepper Jessen compiled a comprehensive knowledge graph using two weeks of intercepted radio communications. However, the complex web of relationships and time-sensitive interactions surpasses the capabilities of traditional analysis. This project leverages visual analytics to support Clepper in identifying key events, uncovering hidden communication patterns, mapping influential entities, and exposing potential misconduct — ultimately revealing the deeper truths behind corruption and manipulation in Oceanus."
