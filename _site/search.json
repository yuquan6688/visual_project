    "text": "This project seeks to uncover hidden influence and illicit activity within the Oceanus community, where tensions are rising following a government crackdown on illegal fishing. As the local economy shifts toward ocean tourism, new entanglements have emerged involving celebrities, local officials, conservation groups, and powerful business families.\nTo investigate these developments, journalist Clepper Jessen compiled a comprehensive knowledge graph using two weeks of intercepted radio communications. However, the complex web of relationships and time-sensitive interactions surpasses the capabilities of traditional analysis. This project leverages visual analytics to support Clepper in identifying key events, uncovering hidden communication patterns, mapping influential entities, and exposing potential misconduct — ultimately revealing the deeper truths behind corruption and manipulation in Oceanus."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our team is developing a visual‐analytics application called Evil under the Sea to uncover hidden corruption and illicit networks beneath Oceanus’s thriving tourism industry. Over a two‐week period, investigative journalist Clepper Jessen gathered intercepted radio communications, permit metadata, and event logs that reveal unauthorized reef exploitation, bribery payments, and secret messages using fake names. He organized this information into a knowledge graph with hundreds of “Entity,” “Event,” and “Relationship” nodes. However, its size and complexity obscure the real patterns, making it difficult to trace who is pulling the strings. With Evil under the Sea, we aim to give investigators an intuitive, data‐driven workspace where they can spot suspicious communication spikes, identify tightly wound subgroups, unravel aliases, and see if key suspects—especially Nadia Conti—remain at the heart of Oceanus’s wrongdoing.\nThe Evil under the Sea dashboard brings all Mini‐Challenge 3 requirements together in one Shiny‐based interface. First, a dynamic EDA module aggregates daily message counts and distributions. Users can switch between weekly, daily, or hourly views with a dropdown or slider. This lets investigators move effortlessly from a broad overview of trends to a close‐up of unusual activity.\nSecond, a unified network visualization combines both global and ego‐centric metrics into a single force‐directed graph. Each node is sized or coloured by its betweenness or degree score—so investigators can immediately see which actors hold the most influence in this “sea” of data. This graph highlights powerful connectors and key intermediaries of “evil” flowing beneath the ocean’s surface.\nThird, a dedicated storyboard panel narrates Nadia Conti’s suspected activities. Here, investigators follow a clear timeline that details her permit approvals, bribery transactions, and covert communications. This is where all the underlying evidence—timestamps and messages—appears, giving a complete picture of her alleged wrongdoing in a maritime setting.\nBy weaving together time controls, a consolidated network dashboard, cluster highlighting, and a narrative timeline, Evil under the Sea transforms Clepper’s dense graph into a streamlined investigative tool. The application would also provide a scalable model for exposing and explaining criminal networks wherever they hide beneath the waves."

He advised that we need only include the most valuable, coherent visuals in the app—selecting key charts rather than embedding every chart from our previous work—and noted that the app should enable users to explore relationships interactively, not merely present answers. He clarified that it is acceptable to focus on just the three questions we have prioritized for this phase (with the fourth optional if time allows) and that we have discretion in structuring our content—combining related network graphs into a single tab or splitting them into subtabs as best suits clarity."

A supporting table below the graph displays values for PageRank, betweenness, and degree centrality.\nTrang also developed two panels: Relationship Network and Clustering Analysis. The Relationship Network panel enables filtering by relationship sub-types and entity sub-types, with a table displaying centrality insights. The Clustering Analysis panel allows viewers to filter by entity sub-types, clustering method, and minimum communication frequency, with results similarly shown in a detailed table.\nTrang proposed combining her network panel with Yuquan’s, given the overlap in network visualizations. Yuquan agreed with this consolidation approach.\nQiuYan presented several interactive visualizations: a timeline, a temporal pattern heatmap, a bar chart of communication partners, and a content analysis table. These are organized into separate tabs and filtered by date range.
