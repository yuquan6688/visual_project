# Meeting Minutes 1

::: callout-note
This is just a short meeting after class.
:::

Date: 24 May 2025 (Saturday)

Time: 4pm

Attendees: Tai QiuYan, Li Yuquan, Do Quynh Trang

## Agenda

1.  Discuss the selection of the project topic

2.  Make a decision on the topic

3.  Discuss follow-up preparations and research plans

## Discussion for Agenda 1

Before the meeting, we had reviewed the three topics from the VAST Challenge 2025, formed our own understanding, and discussed based on that.

Trang pointed out that since Prof. Kam had covered data processing and EDA for MC1 in class, it would be easier for us to understand and continue with. Therefore, she preferred to choose MC1 as our project topic.

Yuquan expressed that although we had some exposure to MC1 in class, its focus on art-related issues made it less intuitive. He was more interested in the theme of MC3.

Trang responded that MC3 has four sub-questions, which may be difficult to distribute among three members. She also felt that MC3 might be more challenging than MC1.

Qiuyan stated that although MC3 might be slightly more difficult, choosing it would avoid overlap with other groups since Prof. Kam had only discussed MC1 in class.

Yuquan added that he had already started working on MC3 previously and had built some foundation in data processing. He felt that MC3 was not significantly more difficult than MC1 based on his experience.

## Discussion for Agenda 2

Trang said that based on the input from Yuquan and Qiuyan, she was open to selecting MC3. However, this might require us to collaboratively complete the extra sub-question, or alternatively, each member could handle two sub-questions as part of Take-home 2.

Qiuyan commented that this would require additional time to understand and explore, and it may not be feasible to complete all sub-questions in Take-home 2, but we can try our best.

Eventually, after discussion and a vote, we decided to choose MC3 as the topic for our project.

## Discussion for Agenda 3

Qiuyan suggested that after completing Take-home 2, we could summarize any difficulties we encountered and consult with Prof. Kam to improve our project.

Yuquan proposed that we wait for Prof. Kam to upload the MC3 data exploration content before moving forward with in-depth study and discussion.

Trang emphasized that we should standardize our data processing workflow so that our individual parts can be better integrated into the Shiny App.

## Decision

After discussion, the group decided to select MC3 from the VAST Challenge 2025 as the topic for our project.

## Next Steps

After completing Take-home 2, we will conduct a more detailed discussion on the project, including division of work, implementation goals, and other key elements.

# Meeting Minutes 2

Date: 3 June 2025 (Tuesday)

Time: 8:00pm

Attendees: Tai QiuYan, Li Yuquan, Do Quynh Trang

## Agenda

1.  Discussion on Take-Home Exercise 3

2.  Discussion on integrating content from Take-Home Exercise 2

3.  Discussion on the expected output of the final Shiny App

4.  Discussion on Proposal structure and division of labor

## Discussion for Agenda 1

YuQuan raised questions about the scope and deliverables for Take-Home Exercise 3.

Trang responded that each member could independently design an analytical storyboard as a project prototype, and we could build on the data wrangling code provided in the MC3 kick-starter.

Qiuyan noted that she was not entirely sure whether the task required us to convert our Take-Home Exercise 2 results into a Shiny App format and suggested clarifying this with Prof. Kam.

## Discussion for Agenda 2

Trang suggested incorporating selected visualizations from Take-Home Exercise 2 into the Shiny App for Take-Home Exercise 3 to form a more coherent project narrative.

YuQuan mentioned that he had reviewed the sample project “The Big Fish,” which did not separate visuals by question but instead integrated them into a few interactive charts that allow users to filter based on different analytical needs.

Qiuyan proposed that we first review the visualizations from Take-Home Exercise 2 and try to merge them if possible.

The team then reviewed the three analytical questions in Mini-Challenge 3 and discussed how to integrate them into a final cohesive report.

## Discussion for Agenda 3

YuQuan presented his visualization results from Take-Home Exercise 2, showing message distribution across Week 1 and Week 2 and later network analysis. He explained the difference between global and ego-based network metrics.

Trang suggested that YuQuan’s Shiny module include a dropdown or slider to allow users to explore the temporal patterns by week, day, or hour.

Qiuyan presented her own Take-Home 2 visualizations and suggested combining the network graphs from different sub-questions into a unified dashboard, as they share similar structures. This could support a consistent narrative showing the interactions between key entities. She also plans to create a storyboard highlighting the timeline and supporting evidence of Nadia Conti’s illegal activities. However, she noted that some of YuQuan’s visualizations are not network-based and may not fully integrate into the dashboard.

Trang shared her own visualizations and proposed that YuQuan take the lead on message distribution while she focuses on network analysis.

YuQuan responded that his network visualizations filtered out all subtypes and sub-relationships, so he was unsure whether they could be merged with Trang’s network section. The team remained uncertain about how to implement Qiuyan’s suggestion for dashboard integration. They agreed to consult Prof. Kam on Thursday for guidance on combining the network visualizations effectively.

## Discussion for Agenda 4

YuQuan proposed referencing the structure used in the previous year’s proposal “The Big Fish,” which includes sections such as Motivation, Objectives, Data, Methodology, Prototypes, Timeline, Tools, and Expected Outcomes. The team agreed to adopt this structure.

Trang suggested postponing the writing of the Methodology section until after consultation with the professor, given the number of open questions.

Qiuyan pointed out that a new website will be needed to publish the final project. She explained how to collaborate using GitHub: each member should work on separate documents and push updates individually to avoid merge conflicts. She also shared a YouTube tutorial on effective GitHub collaboration.

Trang recommended that group members notify each other via WhatsApp when changes are made to the repository so everyone can pull the latest version.

After the discussion, the following division of labor for the Proposal and Meeting Minutes was made:

| Task                       | OIC              |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| Write Minutes of Meeting 1 | QiuYan           |
| Proposal Writing           | Trang and Yuquan |
| Build the website & Github | Yuquan           |

## Next Steps

The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 5 June 2025, at 6:30 PM.

After the professor consultation, the team will proceed with finalizing the proposal and project development plan.

# Meeting Minutes 3

Date: 6 June 2025 (Friday)

Time: 8:00 AM

Attendees: Tai QiuYan, Li Yuquan, Do Quynh Trang

## Agenda

1.  Review Prof. Kam’s feedback on project scope and storyboard requirements
2.  Discuss selection of visuals and questions focus
3.  GitHub collaboration and version control guidance

## Discussion for Agenda 1

Trang wanted to confirm the points covered during the meeting with Prof. Kam. QiuYan and Yuquan mentioned the following discussion points:

Prof. Kam emphasized that for Take-Home 3 each team member should produce a hand-drawn storyboard sketch (inspired by the Walker et al. and decoding-chaos examples) detailing the UI components and user flow of our Shiny app, after which we will meet to compare and finalize the design. He advised that we need only include the most valuable, coherent visuals in the app—selecting key charts rather than embedding every chart from our previous work—and noted that the app should enable users to explore relationships interactively, not merely present answers. He clarified that it is acceptable to focus on just the three questions we have prioritized for this phase (with the fourth optional if time allows) and that we have discretion in structuring our content—combining related network graphs into a single tab or splitting them into subtabs as best suits clarity.

## Discussion for Agenda 2

The team agreed to focus exclusively on Questions 1, 2, and 4, as addressed in Take-Home Exercise 2. Our Shiny app will be built around these three questions. Question 3 will be deprioritized unless we finish the other three ahead of schedule.

## Discussion for Agenda 3

Yuquan also walked the team through the GitHub process: they agreed to notify teammates via WhatsApp before pushing updates, ensuring everyone saves and closes the Shiny app before pulling changes. He emphasized using RStudio’s history panel for version control and for rolling back if needed. To avoid overlap and minimize merge conflicts, each member will be responsible for a single tab aligned with their storyboard sketch: Yuquan will manage the “Temporal Patterns” tab, Trang the “Network Analysis” tab, and Qiuyan the “Illegal Activity Investigation” tab.

## Next Steps

The next meeting will be scheduled after completing Take-Home Exercise 3. Exact date will be confirmed via WhatsApp once everyone has submitted their sketches.

# Meeting Minutes 4

Date: 14 June 2025 (Saturday)

Time: 4:00pm

Attendees: Tai QiuYan, Li Yuquan, Do Quynh Trang

## Agenda

1.  Selection of visuals from Take-Home Exercises 2 and 3 for integration into the final project
2.  Discussion on the UI design and layout of the final Shiny App
3.  Division of labour for final app development

## Discussion for Agenda 1

The meeting commenced with each member presenting their storyboard designs developed for Take-Home Exercise 3. After the presentations, Trang suggested that Yuquan retain his existing layout but enhance it by adding boxes above the EDA section to display key statistical summaries related to time-based analysis.

Yuquan agreed with the proposal.

Yuquan further proposed consolidating the network graphs created by all members into a single panel. This unified network panel would visualize the relationships among all entities and include filtering and selection features. The team agreed to this integrated approach, with Yuquan and Trang jointly responsible for its development.

QiuYan noted that her storyboard for Question 4 currently only left with a timeline. She proposed enhancing it by adding visuals or a table to provide more details on Nadia Conti’s criminal activities. In response, Trang suggested including a table that displays conversational evidence alongside the timeline. QiuYan accepted this recommendation.

## Discussion for Agenda 2

Trang proposed modifying the Shiny App’s layout by placing the panel tabs at the top of the interface rather than on the left side.

The team reached a consensus on this layout change, and all members agreed to update their respective codes accordingly. Additionally, Trang and Yuquan discussed the filtering options to be implemented in the network graph panel.

## Discussion for Agenda 3

The team agreed to divide the final app development according to the questions each member had worked on in Take-Home Exercise 2. Each member would be responsible for developing a separate panel, which would then be integrated into a single Shiny App: Panel 1 (Question 1): Yuquan Panel 2 (Question 2): Trang Panel 3 (Question 4): QiuYan

## Next Steps

The next meeting will be scheduled on 22/6/2025 1:00pm after everyone finishing their parts for shiny app.

# Meeting Minutes 5

Date: 22 June 2025 (Sunday)

Time: 1:00pm

Attendees: Tai QiuYan, Li Yuquan, Do Quynh Trang

## Agenda

1.  Review of individual panel designs for the Shiny App
2.  Division of labour for project consolidation and final deliverables

## Discussion for Agenda 1

Yuquan presented two panels he had developed: Time-Based Analysis and Network Analysis. He demonstrated the filtering capabilities of the Time-Based panel, including options to view data by day, week, or specific dates. The Network Analysis panel includes selections for ego network order, network layout by centrality type, entity type, and influence category. A supporting table below the graph displays values for PageRank, betweenness, and degree centrality.

Trang also developed two panels: Relationship Network and Clustering Analysis. The Relationship Network panel enables filtering by relationship sub-types and entity sub-types, with a table displaying centrality insights. The Clustering Analysis panel allows viewers to filter by entity sub-types, clustering method, and minimum communication frequency, with results similarly shown in a detailed table.

Trang proposed combining her network panel with Yuquan’s, given the overlap in network visualizations. Yuquan agreed with this consolidation approach.

QiuYan presented several interactive visualizations: a timeline, a temporal pattern heatmap, a bar chart of communication partners, and a content analysis table. These are organized into separate tabs and filtered by date range. Trang suggested combining the timeline with the content analysis side-by-side for better contextual understanding and integrating temporal and communication patterns into a unified view. QiuYan agreed to revise accordingly.

Yuquan recommended that after all components are merged into the final Shiny App, the team should schedule a consultation with Prof. Kam for feedback and further refinement. The team concurred.

## Discussion for Agenda 2

Yuquan volunteered to consolidate all teammates’ code into the final Shiny App. Trang will source a suitable poster template via Canva and finalize the UI design for Shiny App. QiuYan will continue preparing the meeting minutes and finalize the project findings section for the group’s website.

## Next Steps

The next meeting will be scheduled for 24 June 2025 (Tuesday) following the consultation session with Prof. Kam.
