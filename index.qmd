Our team developed a Shiny-based visual analytics application titled Behind the Reef to investigate hidden corruption and illicit networks in Oceanus’s tourism and environmental sectors. This project was built in response to the 2025 VAST Challenge – Mini-Challenge 3, based on intercepted radio communications and event metadata collected over two weeks by investigative journalist Clepper Jessen.

The dataset, organized as a knowledge graph of entities, events, and relationships, is large and complex, making it difficult to trace meaningful patterns manually. Our application empowers users to uncover suspicious communication patterns, identify key influencers, and explore tightly connected subgroups within this intricate network.

Behind the Reef features two core components:

1.  A Time-Based Analysis module that allows users to explore hourly or daily communication trends through interactive charts. Investigators can isolate peak activity windows, compare different weeks, and detect anomalies over time.

2.  An interactive network analysis dashboard that combines ego-network, relationship-based, and clustering visualizations. Users can explore influence metrics such as PageRank, Betweenness, and Degree; search for specific entities; and filter by relationship type or subnetwork density—enabling the discovery of power brokers, covert coordinators, and high-risk clusters.

By blending temporal and structural analysis in an intuitive interface, our app offers a scalable investigative tool that helps make sense of dense communication data, allowing analysts to “see beneath the surface” and expose what lies behind the reef.
