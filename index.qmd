**Behind the Reef** is a Shiny-based visual analytics application developed to investigate hidden corruption and illicit networks within Oceanus’s tourism and environmental sectors. Created in response to the 2025 VAST Challenge – Mini-Challenge 3, the project draws on two weeks of intercepted radio communications and event metadata collected by investigative journalist Clepper Jessen.

The dataset, structured as a knowledge graph of entities, events, and relationships, is both large and complex, making manual analysis impractical. Our application enables users to uncover suspicious communication patterns, pinpoint influential actors, and explore tightly connected subgroups within the network.

The tool offers two main modules:

1.  **Time-Based Analysis**: Interactive charts reveal daily and hourly communication trends, allowing users to isolate peak activity periods, compare across weeks, and identify temporal anomalies.
2.  **Network Analysis Dashboard**: This interactive suite combines ego networks, relationship views, and clustering algorithms. Users can explore centrality metrics (PageRank, Betweenness, Degree), search for specific entities, and filter by relationship type or network density to surface key players and covert collaborations.

By blending temporal and structural insights in an intuitive interface, *Behind the Reef* provides a scalable tool for investigative analysis—helping users “see beneath the surface” and reveal what truly lies behind the reef.
