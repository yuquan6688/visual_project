Our team is developing a visual‐analytics application called **Evil under the Sea** to uncover hidden corruption and illicit networks beneath Oceanus’s thriving tourism industry. Over a two‐week period, investigative journalist Clepper Jessen gathered intercepted radio communications, permit metadata, and event logs that reveal unauthorized reef exploitation, bribery payments, and secret messages using fake names. He organized this information into a knowledge graph with hundreds of “Entity,” “Event,” and “Relationship” nodes. However, its size and complexity obscure the real patterns, making it difficult to trace who is pulling the strings. With Evil under the Sea, we aim to give investigators an intuitive, data‐driven workspace where they can spot suspicious communication spikes, identify tightly wound subgroups, unravel aliases, and see if key suspects—especially Nadia Conti—remain at the heart of Oceanus’s wrongdoing.

The Evil under the Sea dashboard brings all Mini‐Challenge 3 requirements together in one Shiny‐based interface. First, a **dynamic EDA module** aggregates daily message counts and distributions. Users can switch between weekly, daily, or hourly views with a dropdown or slider. This lets investigators move effortlessly from a broad overview of trends to a close‐up of unusual activity.

Second, a **unified network visualization** combines both global and ego‐centric metrics into a single force‐directed graph. Each node is sized or coloured by its betweenness or degree score—so investigators can immediately see which actors hold the most influence in this “sea” of data. This graph highlights powerful connectors and key intermediaries of “evil” flowing beneath the ocean’s surface.

Third, a dedicated **storyboard panel** narrates Nadia Conti’s suspected activities. Here, investigators follow a clear timeline that details her permit approvals, bribery transactions, and covert communications. This is where all the underlying evidence—timestamps and messages—appears, giving a complete picture of her alleged wrongdoing in a maritime setting.

By weaving together time controls, a consolidated network dashboard, cluster highlighting, and a narrative timeline, Evil under the Sea transforms Clepper’s dense graph into a streamlined investigative tool. The application would also provide a scalable model for exposing and explaining criminal networks wherever they hide beneath the waves.
